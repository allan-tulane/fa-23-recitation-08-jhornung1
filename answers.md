So if we use V as the amount of vertices and E as the amount of edges in a graph that is passed to shortest_shortest_path, then the work is equal to $O(N^3)$ and the span is equal to $)(N * E)$. This is because for work has three nested loops, and the span is very simple as its just how many possible combinations of vertixes and edges.
